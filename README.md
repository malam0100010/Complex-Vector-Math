# Complex-Vector-Math

 This program allows a user to specify a given cartesian point and move it a certain angle or via a vector. This program is intended to demonstrate skills with pointers, header files, make files, and general I/O. 

 Sample execution: 
 
 Menu:
 
        1) Enter point (x, y) coordinate
        2) Rotate point by angle
        3) Rotate point by vector
        0) Quit
Choice: 1

Enter point x coordinate: 1

Enter point y coordinate: 2

Menu:

        1) Enter point (x, y) coordinate
        2) Rotate point by angle
        3) Rotate point by vector
        0) Quit
Choice: 2

Enter angle in degrees: 45

The point (1, 2) rotated by 45 degrees is now at (-0.707107, 2.12132)

Menu:

        1) Enter point (x, y) coordinate
        2) Rotate point by angle
        3) Rotate point by vector
        0) Quit
Choice: 3

Enter vector x coordinate: 1
Enter vector y coordinate: 1

The point (-0.707107, 2.12132) rotated by the vector <1, 1> (45 degrees) is now at (-2, 1)

Menu:

        1) Enter point (x, y) coordinate
        2) Rotate point by angle
        3) Rotate point by vector
        0) Quit
Choice: 2

Enter angle in degrees: -90
The point (-2, 1) rotated by -90 degrees is now at (1, 2)

Menu:

        1) Enter point (x, y) coordinate
        2) Rotate point by angle
        3) Rotate point by vector
        0) Quit
Choice: 3

Enter vector x coordinate: -1

Enter vector y coordinate: 0

The point (1, 2) rotated by the vector <-1, 0> (180 degrees) is now at (-1, -2)

Menu:

        1) Enter point (x, y) coordinate
        2) Rotate point by angle
        3) Rotate point by vector
        0) Quit
Choice: 5
